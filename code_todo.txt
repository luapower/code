	- create tooltip list from the syntax hightlighter
	- integrate a Lua linter

QUESTIONS
---------
- find/replace macros:
	- make a table based on separators (see automatic table formatting above)
- bookmarks:
	- how to manage writing code and browsing the same code (but different parts of it) at the same time? split view?
		- idea: simple shortcut to go back to where the cursor was last time you were typing (i always use ctrl+z/ctrl+y)

features I never use
	- macros
	- printing (so 50s)
	- code folding (maybe something like autofolding/unfolding with a side window for fold contents?)
	- line wrapping
	- multiple selections
